What can it (and usually is) used for is changing SysCFG values (i.e. serial, wmac, bmac)

## Okay but there's tons of other tools that do this

Well yeah, but, this tool is:
- MUCH more reliable (doesn't crash randomly leaving you to figure it out on your own)
- can be used on any mac (even linux to an extent)
- Open-source (uses existing OSS tools) and not ofsucated
